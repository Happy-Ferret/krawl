Crawl is a new programming language being developed mostly by me. It is largely
based on the mix of Go and C programming languages. Currently it's not ready
for end user usage, but if you're interested in programming languages
development, find us on IRC: #crawlang @ freenode.

For a sneak peek take a look at this document:
