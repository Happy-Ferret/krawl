Krawl was an experimental programming language. It is largely based on the mix
of Go and C programming languages. Currently the project is abandoned, but still
here for educational purposes.

There is only one document describing krawl:

Portability notes:
 - works on x86, linux
 - va_list is broken on amd64
 - almost works on darwin, there are some problems with clang plugin
 - haven't tried it on windows, most likely doesn't work at all
