Krawl is a new programming language being developed mostly by me. It is largely
based on the mix of Go and C programming languages. Currently it's not ready
for end user usage, but if you're interested in programming languages
development, find us on IRC: #krawling @ freenode.

For a sneak peek take a look at this document:

Portability notes:
 - works on x86, linux
 - va_list is broken on amd64
 - almost works on darwin, there are some problems with clang plugin
 - haven't tried it on windows, most likely doesn't work at all
